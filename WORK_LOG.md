| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                  I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |

| Jan 27  |  2:00-2:30  |                                                                                                                                                            Discussed about the problem more |
| Feb 1   | 8:45 - 9:20 | Thought about the problem set more its really hard because I'm not sure how to make it so we get every possible combination. Started just making functions I think will be helpful later on |
| Feb 2   | 10:00-10:20 |                                                                                                                                Fixed the function because I made a couple of small mistakes |
