| Jan 27  |  2:00-2:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Discussed about the problem more |
| Feb 1   | 8:45 - 9:20 |                                                                                      Thought about the problem set more its really hard because I'm not sure how to make it so we get every possible combination. Started just making functions I think will be helpful later on |
| Feb 2   | 10:00-10:20 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fixed the function because I made a couple of small mistakes |
| Feb 2   | 10:45-11:55 |                                                                                                    Tried to understand the memoization approach. I still don't really understand it, but I just tried to code something that might work although doesn't currently save anything |
| Feb 10  | 10:00-10:40 |                  I kept on getting a index out of bounds error. So I went I checked why and I realized that I was acting as if the coin value was the index value which wasn't correct. I was also confusing if my coins array was sorted greatest to least or least to greatest |
| Feb 10  |  1:00-1:15  | After fixing the out of bounds error I was getting an answer one off, to help me debug I made a really easy tester class and found the problem is I was returning the wrong saved value when solving. After fixing that my memoization approach worked, now to do Tabulation :') |
